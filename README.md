# Hobbyist_Embedded_Projects

After being exposed to the Atmel based microcontroller at University, I decided to try out an Arm Based microcontroller. 
So during the summer of 2019 I audited the following course on Edx https://www.edx.org/course/embedded-systems-shape-the-world-microcontroller-i
and familiriazed myself with a different kind of microcontroller and its specialised IDE Keil UVision. I definitely recommend this course if you're new to embedded programming and want to build up a strong interest and background. It also has a very active online forum where you can ask questions.
I recently became familiar with GitHub and Git so I decided to upload the projects I undertook for the purpose of expanding and editing them in the near future. 
I hope you enjoy working through the course and find some of these projects interesting and helpful :)
